    "The Problem:  Clinical diagnosis of a chest x-ray can be challenging and time-consuming (in non-emergency settings), sometimes more difficult than diagnosis via chest CT imaging.  I will try and solve the problem by training a classifier to predict the type of disease given an x-ray image.  Essentially I will be using deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which will be used to detect and diagnose disease.  Ultimately, this type of machine learning mechanism can lead to clinicians making better diagnostic decisions for patients.  Further, it can help in identifying slow changes occurring over the course of multiple chest x-rays that might otherwise be overlooked."
