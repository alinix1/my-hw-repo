**Overall:** Good work! You definitely are comfy with your stats, and it seems you are getting more comfortable with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Keep that up! 

**Something to think about:**

* Quick point: log(p/1-p) != ln(p/1-p) as one is base e and the other is base 10, but I appreciated the expression in there! Also, you can use [latex like expressions](http://data-blog.udacity.com/posts/2016/10/latex-primer/) **in** jupyter notebooks via Markdown cells. No need for the Display library.

***Note: Given you already have some solid experience in programming and stats, if you ever feel a topic is too elementary or you want more, please ask for some suggestions for more advanced readings! I can send things your way, especially once we get into modeling!***

***Also: I did not know that you could do that trick with categorical variables in statsmodels! That's handy. When we use other packages, you'll have to OHE the variables yourselves via sklearn's OneHotEncoder or Pandas get_dummies().***
